Setup
Add paths for input and output. Your images should be in their own folder. Or just check use sample data, and the input and ouput will be covered for you. For ease of use, I recommend mounting your Google Drive (see section below), then setting your input and output locations to somewhere inside your drive.

In [ ]:
image_folder_path = "" #@param {type:"string"}
output_path = "" #@param {type:"string"}
use_sample_data = False #@param {type:"boolean"}
Download Meshroom and sample data(if needed).

In [ ]:
if use_sample_data:
  !git clone https://github.com/alicevision/dataset_buddha
  image_folder_path = './dataset_buddha/buddha'
  output_path = './buddha_out'

!wget -N https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom/releases/download/v2019.1.0/Meshroom-2019.1.0-linux.tar.gz
!mkdir meshroom
!tar xzf Meshroom-2019.1.0-linux.tar.gz -C ./meshroom
Google Drive
Connect to Google Drive, so that you can import and export files from there.

In [ ]:
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
